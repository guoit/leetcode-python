"""
115 Distinct Subsequences

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Here is an example:
S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

Return 3.

# similar problems: 392 Is Subsequence
# discussion: different from 392, which can use two-pointer method with O(n+m) time complexity, constant space to check if s is a subsequence of t. This problem needs a number, so we have to use DP with space complexity O(n*m)
